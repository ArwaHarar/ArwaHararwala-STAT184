# Class Schedule

### STAT 184: Introduction to R Programming

Being an Applied Data Science major at Penn State University, stat 184 is a required course. Even though this class is a requirement, this course is very important to me because knowing R will allow me to excel in future classes and be more educated on different languages that are used to process data.

The link to download R programming is [linked here](https://www.r-project.org/).

### DS 220: Data Management

This class is also one of the required courses for the Applied Data Sciece major. I am taking this course because it is very important for me to learn how to store and properly manage data. Also, this class is going to teach me all of the valuable tools that are used in data analytics that will be needed for taking more advanced courses in the future.

### DS 310: Machine Learning and Data Analytics

Data Scince 310 is a very interesting course that I am taking in order to learn more about deep learning that is used in machine learning and data analytics. This class important for my major becuase it is allowing me to see the practical application of all of the math skills I have learned by designing and using algorithms to "teach" machines to be able to recognize patterns.
